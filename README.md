# Hello-k3s-ansible

A minimal, production-style DevOps project to deploy a lightweight Flask web application using **Terraform Cloud**, **GitHub Actions**, **Ansible**, **Docker**, and **K3s on AWS EC2** — all within the **AWS Free Tier**.

This project follows **industry-standard best practices**, including secure CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, Kubernetes deployment, and automated provisioning. It was created to demonstrate real-world DevOps skills in a simple, understandable, and recruiter-friendly way.

## ✅ Completed Sprints

### ✅ Sprint 1: Project Initialization
- ✅ Defined project goals and DevOps stack
- ✅ Chose lightweight architecture (Flask + K3s)
- ✅ Established Agile-based Sprint methodology

### ✅ Sprint 2: Terraform Cloud Setup
- ✅ Installed Terraform CLI and connected to Terraform Cloud
- ✅ Created AWS EC2 instance using `t2.micro`
- ✅ Configured `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, and `outputs.tf`
- ✅ Automatically generates Ansible inventory from EC2 IP

### ✅ Sprint 3: Ansible Provisioning
- ✅ Installed Docker and K3s on the EC2 instance
- ✅ WSL (Ubuntu) used to run Ansible locally and test configuration
- ✅ Automated provisioning and verified Kubernetes installation
- ✅ Refactored Terraform to inject CI SSH key using `user_data`

### ✅ Sprint 4: Docker + Flask Application
- ✅ Built a minimal Flask app with a basic HTML UI
- ✅ Used multi-stage Docker build for smallest possible image
- ✅ Verified local execution and pushed to Docker Hub (`fragmendal/hello-k3s-flask`)
- ✅ Docker image build/push automated via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Workflow triggers only on Flask app changes

### ✅ Sprint 5: Kubernetes Deployment
- ✅ Created Kubernetes manifests (`flask-deployment.yaml`, `flask-service.yaml`)
- ✅ Applied manifests on K3s cluster via Ansible
- ✅ Exposed app using NodePort service (`:30001`)
- ✅ App publicly accessible via EC2 IP + NodePort

### ✅ Sprint 6: CI/CD Automation
- ✅ GitHub Actions dynamically fetches EC2 IP from Terraform Cloud
- ✅ SSHs using CI key securely stored in GitHub Secrets
- ✅ Runs Ansible provisioning end-to-end via CI pipeline
- ✅ Entire workflow is idempotent, automated, and secure
- ✅ OIDC authentication replaces static AWS credentials
- ✅ Workflow runs only after successful Terraform Apply

### ✅ Sprint 7: Terraform Cloud Trigger Optimization
- ✅ Disabled `.tfcignore` attempt (not supported in TFC)
- ✅ Enabled **Push Trigger Filters** in Terraform Cloud UI
- ✅ Configured to trigger runs **only when files inside `terraform/` change**
- ✅ Confirmed that README or app changes no longer trigger Terraform runs

### ✅ Sprint 8: Provisioning Workflow Refinement
- ✅ Ansible workflow now checks if EC2 is already provisioned via marker file (`/etc/provisioned_by_ansible`)
- ✅ Full provisioning (`install,k3s,deploy`) runs only once per instance
- ✅ Subsequent runs use Git diff to selectively apply `--tags install`, `--tags deploy`, or both
- ✅ Tags are automatically chosen based on file changes in `ansible/` or `kubernetes/`
- ✅ Kubernetes manifests (`flask-deployment.yaml`, `flask-service.yaml`) are cleaned up after deployment
- ✅ Ansible workflow automatically skips if no EC2 is present or no relevant files have changed

### ✅ Sprint 9: Testing and Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Added unit testing to Flask app using `pytest`
- ✅ Created `test_app.py` to validate homepage rendering
- ✅ Integrated tests into CI workflow via GitHub Actions (`test.yml`)
- ✅ Added Checkov to scan Terraform configuration (`iac-checks.yml`)
- ✅ Added `ansible-lint` to validate Ansible playbooks (`ansible-lint.yml`)
- ✅ All test and security tools are integrated into CI/CD

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Terraform Cloud** provisions the EC2 instance
2. The instance is configured with two SSH keys:
   - Your **personal key** for manual access
   - A **CI key** injected via `user_data` for GitHub Actions
3. **GitHub Actions** detects new IP from Terraform Cloud using the `paambaati/tfc-output-action` plugin
4. Ansible connects via SSH to provision Docker, K3s, and deploy the Flask app
5. A marker file (`/etc/provisioned_by_ansible`) ensures the playbook only runs once per instance
6. The app is available at `http://<ec2_ip>:30001`
7. Flask app unit tests are run on each push
8. Terraform code is scanned by Checkov for security best practices
9. Ansible playbooks are validated by Ansible-Lint for syntax and quality

## ⚙️ CI/CD Workflows

### 🔧 Terraform Workflow (Terraform Cloud VCS-connected)
- Triggers on changes to files inside `/terraform`
- Applies infrastructure changes automatically

### 🤖 Ansible + K3s Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/ansible.yml`
- Triggers on changes to `ansible/**` or `kubernetes/**`
- Fetches EC2 IP dynamically from Terraform Cloud
- SSHs into EC2 using CI key
- Checks for `/etc/provisioned_by_ansible` marker
- Runs Ansible playbook with smart tag selection

### 🧪 Flask App Unit Tests
**File:** `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- Triggers on changes to `flask-app/**`
- Runs tests using `pytest` with `test_app.py`

### 🔍 Terraform Security Scan
**File:** `.github/workflows/iac-checks.yml`
- Triggers on changes to `terraform/**`
- Uses Checkov to detect misconfigurations or security risks

### 🔎 Ansible Lint
**File:** `.github/workflows/ansible-lint.yml`
- Triggers on changes to `ansible/**`
- Runs `ansible-lint` on `ansible/playbook.yml`
- Fails on bad practices, formatting, or syntax errors

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices
- 🧑‍💻 Developer and CI access keys are **separated**
- 🔐 SSH private keys stored in **GitHub Secrets**
- ☁️ AWS access via **OIDC GitHub Identity Federation**
- 🧱 Terraform IAM user has a **minimal IAM policy** (except for temporary use of EC2FullAccess)
- 🛡️ Terraform code is continuously scanned for security issues with Checkov
- 🧹 Ansible playbooks are continuously linted for quality

---

## 🧰 Dev Environment
- **Windows 11** + **WSL2 Ubuntu**
- GitHub, Terraform CLI, AWS CLI, Docker Desktop
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
